### Hi there 👋

My name is Brunno Diego, from São Paulo - Brazil(🇧🇷). 
I work as Ux Design / front-end developer since 2018, currently developing this function at Banco Original, 
and with little time, you can use github as a post code.
In my free time, I like to play (and watch) football (⚽️), watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), read books (📚), listen to music (🎵) and eventually like to philosophize about life with a beer ( 🍺).

Would you like to meet me?
